(TITLE OF THE INVENTION) Image Forming Apparatus and Image Forming Method Field of the Invention A light emitting element included in an image forming apparatus is degraded by emitting light, and the light emission amount is reduced.
When the light emission amount decreases, the light emission amount of each light emitting element becomes non-uniform, and the printing quality deteriorates.
Therefore, it is desirable that the light emission amount of each light emitting element is maintained uniformly.
As a method therefor, there has been proposed a method of uniformly adjusting the light emission amount of the entire light emitting element.
For example, a method of controlling the driving current of each light emitting element based on the measured light emission amount of each light emitting element at the time of light emission.
A method of controlling a driving current of each light emitting element based on the cumulative driving time of each light emitting element and characteristic data of a light emission amount.
Data opposite to the data for forming an electrostatic latent image is created, and each light emitting element emits light.
This is a method of making the light emitting time of each light emitting element uniform.
However, increasing the light emission amount of the light emitting element by the driving current further accelerates the deterioration of the light emitting element.
Also, forcibly causing the light emitting element to emit light in order to make the light emitting time of the light emitting element uniform may sometimes accelerate the deterioration of the light emitting element.

FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram illustrating a functional configuration of the light emitting unit 305 of the embodiment.
The image forming apparatus 100 includes a light emission time storage unit 301, a shortest storage unit 302, a longest storage unit 303, an adjustment time storage unit 304, a light emission unit 305, and a control unit 310.
The light emission time storage unit 301 is configured using a storage device such as a magnetic hard disk device or a semiconductor storage device.
The light emission time storage unit 301 stores the accumulated light emission times of the plurality of light emitting elements 306 included in the light emitting unit 305.
The cumulative light emission time is the sum of the light emission times during which the light emitting element 306 emits light.
The accumulated light emission time is stored for each light emitting element 306.
The emission time storage unit 301 stores a plurality of cumulative issue times.
Each time the light emitting element 306 emits light, one accumulated light emitting time increases.
The accumulated light emission time is used to adjust the light amount of the light emitting unit 305.
The shortest storage unit 302 is configured using a storage device such as a magnetic hard disk device or a semiconductor storage device.
The shortest storage unit 302 stores the smallest value among the accumulated light emission times of the plurality of light emitting elements stored in the light emission time storage unit 301.
The accumulated light emission time stored in the shortest storage unit 302 is used when the difference value is calculated by the difference calculation unit 312.
In the present embodiment, only the shortest value is stored, but, for example, three cumulative light emission times may be selected in ascending order and the average thereof may be stored.
The longest storage unit 303 is configured using a storage device such as a magnetic hard disk device or a semiconductor storage device.
The longest storage unit 303 stores the highest value among the accumulated light emission times of the plurality of light emitting elements stored in the light emission time storage unit 301.
When a value greater than the accumulated light emission time stored in the longest storage unit 303 is generated among the plurality of accumulated light emission times stored in the light emission time storage unit 301, the value stored in the longest storage unit 303 is updated.
The accumulated light emission time stored in the longest storage unit 303 is used when the difference calculation unit 312 calculates a difference value.
In the present embodiment, only the highest value is stored, but, for example, three cumulative light emission times may be selected in descending order and the average thereof may be stored.
The adjustment time storage unit 304 is configured using a storage device such as a magnetic hard disk device or a semiconductor storage device.
The adjustment time storage unit 304 stores the adjustment time.
The adjustment time is a value smaller than the accumulated light emission time stored in the longest storage unit 303 and larger than the accumulated light emission time stored in the shortest storage unit 302.
In the present embodiment, the value of (cumulative light emission time stored in the longest storage unit 303−cumulative light emission time stored in the shortest storage unit 302) ÷ 2 is used.
The adjustment time may be calculated by any other method.
The light emitting element 306 whose cumulative light emission time stored in the light emission time storage unit 301 is less than the adjustment time is forcibly emitted until the adjustment time.
The control unit 310 controls the operation of each unit of the image forming apparatus 100.
The control unit 310 is executed by, for example, a device including a CPU (Central Processing Unit) and a RAM (Random Access Memory).
The control section 310 functions as a light emission time determination section 311, a difference calculation section 312, a difference determination section 313, a light emission control section 314, and an adjustment time calculation section 315 by executing the image forming program.
The light emission time determination unit 311 updates the shortest storage unit 302 and the longest storage unit 303.
First, updating of the shortest storage unit 302 will be described.
The light emission time determination unit 311 determines whether the cumulative light emission time stored in the shortest storage unit 302 and the plurality of cumulative light emission times stored in the light emission time storage unit 301 satisfy a predetermined condition.
The light emission time determination unit 311 determines whether the cumulative light emission time stored in the shortest storage unit 302 and the plurality of cumulative light emission times stored in the light emission time storage unit 301 satisfy a predetermined condition.
When comparing the plurality of accumulated light emission times stored in the light emission time storage unit 301 with the accumulated light emission time stored in the shortest storage unit 302, the predetermined condition is, for example, whether the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306 is smaller or not. It may be.
Next, updating of the longest storage unit 303 will be described.
When comparing the plurality of accumulated light emission times stored in the light emission time storage unit 301 with the longest storage unit 303, the predetermined condition may be, for example, whether or not the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306 is longer.
The predetermined condition may be any condition as long as the magnitude relationship between the accumulated light emission time stored in the shortest storage unit 302 or the longest storage unit 303 and the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306 can be compared.
When a predetermined condition is satisfied, the light emission time determination unit 311 records the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306 in the determined shortest storage unit 302 or longest storage unit 303.
The difference calculation unit 312 calculates a difference value between the accumulated light emission time stored in the longest storage unit 303 and the accumulated light emission time stored in the shortest storage unit 302.
The difference determination unit 313 determines whether the difference value calculated by the difference calculation unit 312 is smaller than the forced light emission threshold.
The forced light emission threshold is a value for determining whether or not the light emitting element 306 is forcibly made to emit light.
When the difference value is smaller than the forced light emission threshold, the light emission control unit 314 does not cause the light emitting element 306 to emit light.
On the other hand, when the difference value is equal to or greater than the forced light emission threshold, the light emission control unit 314 causes the light emitting element 306 to emit light.
The forced light emission threshold is recorded in the image forming apparatus 100 in advance.
The light emission control unit 314 controls light emission of the light emitting element 306.
The light emission control unit 314 increases the cumulative light emission time of the light emitting element 306 that has emitted light when the light emitting element 306 emits light.
The light emission control unit 314 causes the light emission time storage unit 301 to store the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306.
The light emission control unit 314 determines whether the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306 is shorter than the adjustment time.
When the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306 is smaller than the adjustment time, data for forcibly emitting light from the light emitting element 306 is generated.
If the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306 is not shorter than the adjustment time, data for not causing the light emitting element 306 to emit light is generated.
The light emission control unit 314 transmits the generated data to the light emission unit 305.
The adjustment time represents a time during which the light emitting element 306 is forced to emit light.
When the accumulated light emitting time of the light emitting element 306 is shorter than the adjustment time, the light emission control unit 314 causes the light emitting element 306 to forcibly emit light until the adjustment time.
The adjustment time is recorded in the image forming apparatus 100 in advance.
Thus, the light emission control unit 314 keeps the light emission amount uniform by causing the light emitting element 306 to emit light.
The forced light emission is preferably performed after the image forming process, but may be performed before the image forming process.
The adjustment time calculation unit 315 calculates an adjustment time.
After calculating the adjustment time, the adjustment time calculation unit causes the adjustment time storage unit 304 to store the adjustment time.

The light emitting element 306 emits light in response to a light emission instruction from the light emission control unit 314.
The data for forced light emission is one mode of light emission instruction.
The light emitting element 306 emits light during the image forming process, thereby causing the photosensitive drum 320 to form an electrostatic latent image.
The light emitting element 306 may be an organic EL (Electro Luminescence) or an LED (Light Emitting Diode).
The light emitting element 306 may be any light emitting element as long as an electrostatic latent image can be formed on the photosensitive drum 320.
The photoconductor drum 320 is installed in the light emitting direction of the light emitting element 306.

FIG. 14 is a diagram illustrating a state in which the accumulated light emission time of the light emitting element 306 has reached the adjustment time after printing 15 sets of image data (B).
The light emitting element 306 whose accumulated light emission time is shorter than the adjustment time emits light until the adjustment time.
As a result, all the light emitting elements 306 have a cumulative light emission time longer than the adjustment time.
As described above, the light emission control unit 314 determines whether the value of the accumulated light emission time stored in the light emission time storage unit 301 is larger than the value of the adjustment time.
If the result of the determination is that the value of the accumulated light emission time is not greater than the value of the adjustment time, the light emission control unit 314 controls the light emitting element 306 to emit light.
On the other hand, when the value of the accumulated light emission time is larger than the value of the adjustment time, the light emission control unit 314 controls the light emitting element 306 not to emit light.
As a result, the light emission control unit 314 causes the light emitting element 306, whose cumulative light emission time value is not greater than the adjustment time value, to emit light up to the adjustment time value.
Therefore, the light emitting time becomes shorter as the difference value between the value of the cumulative light emitting time and the value of the adjustment time becomes longer than when each light emitting element 306 emits light up to the value of the cumulative light emitting time having the largest cumulative light emitting time.
Therefore, the light emitting element 306 is suppressed from being deteriorated by light emission by the difference value while maintaining the light emission amount uniform.
