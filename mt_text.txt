MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The following exemplary embodiments and modifications include the same components.
Therefore, in the following, the same components are denoted by the same reference numerals, and redundant description is omitted.
<First Embodiment> The attachment device 10 (gel sheet, adhesive pad, gel pad) according to the present embodiment is a flat, rectangular, for example, rectangular sheet-like device having flexibility.
The mounting device 10 can be mounted on a surface 14a (sensor surface, top surface, first wall) that is a part of the housing 14 of the electronic device 12.
The electronic device 12 is, for example, a portable sensor unit that can detect a cardiac potential and the like.
The housing 14 of the electronic device 12 is formed by, for example, insert molding using a synthetic resin material, and a substrate supporting a plurality of electronic components and electrodes to be described later is covered with the synthetic resin material during insert molding. Formed.
The housing 14 is, for example, a flat rectangular parallelepiped, and the surface 14a has electrodes 16a, 16b (probe, terminal, metal, conductor) and its detection surface (sensor surface, end, surface, one end surface) has a surface. It is arranged in a state exposed from 14a.
The electrode 16a is, for example, a “+ electrode”, and the electrode 16b is, for example, a “− electrode”, which are arranged apart from each other.
When the electronic device 12 detects a biological signal (potential, cardiac potential) for creating an electrocardiogram, a more stable detection result is obtained when the distance between the electrode 16a and the electrode 16b is equal to or longer than a predetermined distance. There are cases.
On the other hand, the smaller the electronic device 12 is, the more the portability and the ease of handling of the electronic device 12 are improved.
Therefore, in the present embodiment, by arranging the electrodes 16a and the electrodes 16b at diagonal positions on the surface 14a, it is possible to suppress the enlargement of the electronic device 12 while securing a predetermined distance between the electrodes 16a and the electrodes 16b. I am trying to be.
In the example of FIG. 1, the electrode 16a is arranged at a position near a corner 18a where the side 14b and the side 14c of the housing 14 intersect.
On the other hand, the electrode 16b is arranged at a position near the corner 18b where the side 14d and the side 14e intersect.
By arranging the electrodes 16a and 16b at diagonal positions in this way, for example, compared to a case where the electrodes 16a and 16b are arranged at a position parallel to the side portion 14c or a position parallel to the side portion 14b. In addition, the distance between the electrode 16a and the electrode 16b can be increased without increasing the size of the housing 14.
Further, the housing 14 can be bent so as to have flexibility (flexibility).
For example, the housing 14 is made of a flexible resin having flexibility.
The housing 14 can be bent into a shape in which a generating line in a direction intersecting with the longitudinal side portions 14c and 14e is formed.
The electrode 16a is arranged at a position near the corner 18a, that is, at one end in the longitudinal direction of the housing 14, and the electrode 16b is arranged at a position near the corner 18b, that is, at the other end of the housing 14 in the longitudinal direction. Become.
As a result, when the electronic device 12 is brought into contact with a body surface having a curved surface, the adhesion of the electrodes 16a and the electrodes 16b present at both ends in the longitudinal direction to the body surface can be improved by bending the housing 14. it can.
The data input / output terminals 20a and 20b (connectors, contacts, electrodes, metals, conductors) are arranged on the front surface 14a in an exposed state.
The input / output terminals 20a and 20b are, for example, a detection value obtained by the electronic device 12, data based on the detection value, information and the like for transferring to an external device in a wired manner, and for controlling the electronic device 12. This can be used when updating the software in a wired manner.
The input / output terminals 20a and 20b can be electrically connected to terminals of a dedicated adapter device such as a cradle.
In the case of FIG. 1, the input / output terminals 20a and 20b are arranged substantially parallel to the side portion 14c, for example, at a position close to the side portion 14c.
The input / output terminals 20a and 20b are not used in a situation where the electronic device 12 is detecting a biological signal.
Also, no current flows between the input / output terminal 20a and the input / output terminal 20b.
Therefore, it is not necessary to arrange the input / output terminals 20a and 20b apart like the electrodes 16a and 16b, and it is possible to arrange them relatively close to each other.
Note that the arrangement of the electrodes 16a, 16b and the input / output terminals 20a, 20b is an example of an arrangement suitable for the electronic device 12 that detects a cardiac potential, and the positions of the electrodes and terminals are selected according to the specifications of the electronic device 12. Is done.
In addition, conductors 22a and 22b (first power terminals, connectors, contacts, electrodes, and metals) are arranged so as to be exposed in a region where no other electrode or terminal is present, for example, a central region on surface 14a.
The conductors 22a and 22b are terminals for receiving power supply from an external power supply.
The conductor 22a is, for example, a “+ power terminal”, and the conductor 22b is, for example, a “−power terminal”, which are arranged at a predetermined distance.
The biological signals detected by the electrodes 16a and 16b are stored in a storage unit mounted on a substrate inside the electronic device 12, and external devices, such as an electrocardiogram output device (an electrocardiograph, a monitor device, and a printing device) at a desired timing. Device), or to a personal computer, server, or the like.
In addition, the data can be transferred to an electrocardiogram output device or a portable terminal in real time.
The electronic device 12 of the present embodiment can transfer a biological signal or the like to an external device by a wired method using the input / output terminals 20a and 20b.
In addition, a biological signal can be transferred to an external device via a communication unit such as Bluetooth (registered trademark).
In such a case, for example, monitoring of the electrocardiogram for 24 hours is possible.
Note that data transfer at a predetermined interval, transfer at a desired timing, or software update of the electronic device 12 can be performed via a communication unit such as Bluetooth.
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the mounting device 10 includes a mounting member 24 having an adhesive property (adhesive layer, base, holding layer) and a battery 26 (battery cell, cell, battery layer).
The mounting member 24 can be mounted on the surface 14a of the housing 14 of the electronic device 12.
The mounting device 10 is interposed between the surface 14a and the body surface in order to further improve the adhesion of the electrodes 16a and the electrodes 16b of the electronic device 12 to the body surface, and by imparting conductivity, The cardiac potential of the user (subject) can be detected by the electrodes 16a and 16b.
The mounting member 24 is at least partially covered with the electronic device 12 having the conductors 22a and 22b and attached to the electronic device 12 with the first surface 24a (mounting surface, power supply surface, first wall, surface), It has a second surface 24b (an attachment surface, a contact surface, a second wall, and a back surface) which is located on the opposite side to the first surface 24a and is attached to the user with adhesiveness.
The attachment member 24 only needs to be able to fix the first surface 24a to the surface 14a of the electronic device 12, and may be fixed to the surface 14a by the adhesiveness of the attachment member 24, for example.
Further, the first surface 24a may be fixed to the surface 14a of the electronic device 12 by mechanically connecting a fixing member extending from the attachment member 24, for example, a belt-shaped member to the electronic device 12.
Further, for example, the first surface 24a of the attachment member 24 and the electronic device 12 may be provided with portions that fit each other, and the first surface 24a may be fixed to the surface 14a by fitting them.
On the other hand, the second surface 24b of the attachment member 24 has an adhesive force for attaching the electronic device 12 to the body surface of the user via the attachment member 24.
In the case of the present embodiment, the first surface 24a has a mounting force for mounting the mounting device 10 on the front surface 14a of the electronic device 12 and maintaining the posture thereof due to the adhesiveness of the mounting member 24.
The battery 26 is at least partially covered by the electronic device 12 and fixed to the mounting member 24.
Then, the electrodes 26a and 26b that are electrically connected to the conductors 22a and 22b and supply power to the electronic device 12 while the mounting member 24 is mounted on the electronic device 12 (second power terminals, connectors, contacts, Terminals, metals, conductors).
As the battery 26, for example, a sheet-shaped primary battery that can be bent in accordance with the flexibility of the mounting member 24 can be employed.
The battery 26 may be fixed on the first surface 24a of the attachment member 24 by the adhesive force of the attachment member 24, or may be fixed so as to be embedded in an inner layer of the attachment member 24.
The electrodes 26a and 26b are arranged at the interval corresponding to the interval between the conductors 22a and 22b, between the midpoint of the longitudinal side 24c (24e) of the mounting member 24 and the lateral side 24d (24f) in the lateral direction. It is arranged at a substantially central position of the mounting member 24 where the points intersect.
The electrode 26a is, for example, a “+ electrode”, and the electrode 26b is, for example, a “− electrode”.
The electrode 16a for detecting the cardiac potential and the electrode 16b need to be electrically insulated.
Therefore, for example, the attachment member 24 may be divided into the first gel region 24g on the electrode 16a side and the second gel region 24h on the electrode 16b side by the battery 26, and the electrode 16a and the electrode 16b may be electrically insulated. .
Further, an insulating material may be disposed on the mounting member 24 separately from the battery 26 to electrically insulate the electrode 16a from the electrode 16b.
The mounting device 10 configured in this manner is overlapped so that the electrode 26a and the conductor 22a are electrically connected and the electrode 26b and the conductor 22b are electrically connected as shown in FIG. Thereby, the electric power of the battery 26 can be supplied to the electronic device 12.
In order to easily and accurately realize the connection between the electrode 26a and the conductor 22a and the connection between the electrode 26b and the conductor 22b, a structure for positioning the surface 14a on the electronic device 12 side and the first surface 24a on the mounting member 24 side. May be provided.
For example, the conductors 22a and 22b are exposed while slightly projecting from the surface 14a.
On the other hand, the electrodes 26a and 26b are recessed from the first surface 24a by an amount corresponding to the amount of protrusion of the conductors 22a and 22b.
With such a configuration, the positioning between the electrode 26a and the conductor 22a and the positioning between the electrode 26b and the conductor 22b can be easily and accurately performed by the combination effect of the unevenness.
Further, as described above, the electrodes 26a and 26b are depressed from the first surface 24a of the mounting member 24 so that, for example, the electrodes 26a and 26b are not mounted on the electronic device 12 while the mounting device 10 is mounted on the electronic device 12. Conduction and discharge of the battery 26 can be suppressed.
Further, in a modified example, a fitting structure for positioning may be arranged at a position different from the electrodes 26a and 26b and the conductors 22a and 22b.
For example, when the battery 26 is fixed on the first surface 24a of the mounting member 24, the entire battery 26 projects from the first surface 24a.
In this case, by providing a recess corresponding to the shape of the battery 26 on the surface 14a of the electronic device 12, the entire battery 26 can be accommodated in the recess, and the electrode 26a and the conductor 22a and the electrode 26b and the conductor 22b Easy and accurate alignment of electrical connections.
Further, by fitting the battery 26 and the concave portion, after the mounting member 24 is mounted on the electronic device 12, it is possible to suppress the two members from being displaced from each other, and the electrical connection between the electrode 26a and the conductor 22a and between the electrode 26b and the conductor 22b. Connection can be maintained.
As shown in FIG. 4, by attaching the attachment device 10 to the electronic device 12, the power of the battery 26 fixed to the attachment member 24 can be supplied to the power supply circuit 28 of the electronic device 12.
That is, the electronic device 12 does not need to include a battery for driving the electronic device 12, and the size and weight of the electronic device 12 can be reduced.
In addition, other electronic components can be arranged in the space where the battery is arranged inside the electronic device 12 so far, and a new function is added to the electronic device 12 while suppressing an increase in the size of the electronic device 12. be able to.
That is, high performance can be easily achieved.
The capacity of the battery 26 can be determined, for example, according to the continuous driving time of the electronic device 12.
For example, when the cardiac potential is continuously detected for 24 hours, the attachment device 10 may be provided with a battery 26 having a sufficient capacity.
Further, since the battery 26 is a sheet-like shape that can be bent in accordance with the flexibility of the mounting member 24, even when the battery 26 is attached to a user's body surface together with the electronic device 12, the battery 26 is easily bent along the curved surface of the body surface. Even if used for a long time, the burden on the user can be reduced.
Further, since the adhesion between the electronic device 12 and the body surface can be easily maintained, it is possible to contribute to stabilization of acquisition of a biological signal such as a cardiac potential and improvement of a situation of acquiring the biological signal.
The battery 26 fixed by the attachment member 24 of the attachment device 10 of the first embodiment is a primary battery that performs only discharge as described above.
Therefore, when the output of the battery 26 falls below the predetermined value, the mounting device 10 is discarded together with the battery 26.
Alternatively, after the attachment member 24 and the battery 26 are separated, they are separately discarded.
<Second Embodiment> FIG. 5 is an explanatory diagram showing a configuration of an attachment device 10 and an electronic device 30 according to a second embodiment.
Although the electronic device 12 described in the first embodiment has a configuration without an internal battery, the electronic device 30 of the second embodiment has a secondary battery 32 (first secondary battery) inside.
In this case, the battery 26 of the mounting device 10 can function as an auxiliary battery for the electronic device 30.
For example, the electronic device 30 basically provides the power of the secondary battery 32 to the power supply circuit 28 to perform an operation of detecting a cardiac potential or the like, an operation of storing the detected cardiac potential, and the like.
In other words, when the output of the secondary battery 32 is equal to or greater than a predetermined value, even when the electrodes 26a and 26b are electrically connected to the conductors 22a and 22b, the power is supplied from the battery 26 to the electronic device 30 (the secondary battery 32). Is not supplied.
On the other hand, when the output of the secondary battery 32 becomes less than the predetermined value, the electronic device 30 receives the power supply from the battery 26 of the mounting device 10 side through the secondary battery 32, and And the operation of storing the detected cardiac potential and the operation of storing the detected cardiac potential are continued.
That is, the electronic device 30 is driven for a long time by using the battery 26 as an auxiliary battery.
In another embodiment, the electronic device 12 is normally driven by power supply from the battery 26, and the secondary battery 32 drives the electronic device 30 when the output of the battery 26 becomes less than a predetermined value. Power may be supplied.
As described above, by providing the power for driving the electronic device 30 with the secondary battery 32 and the battery 26, the capacity of each battery can be reduced.
That is, the size and weight of the electronic device 30 can be reduced as compared with the case where similar long-time driving is realized only by the electronic device 30.
Further, when the same long-time driving is realized by the electronic device 12 shown in the first embodiment, it is necessary to provide the attachment device 10 with the large-capacity battery 26.
On the other hand, according to the configuration of the second embodiment, the required capacity can be shared between the secondary battery 32 and the battery 26, so that the size and weight of each battery can be reduced.
Further, a configuration in which the standard driving time of the electronic device 30 is covered by the secondary battery 32 and the additional driving time is covered by the battery 26 becomes possible.
For example, if a plurality of types of mounting devices 10 having batteries 26 with different capacities are prepared, an electronic device 30 that can realize different driving times by selecting the disposable mounting device 10 can be configured.
As a result, the usability of the user is improved.
When power is supplied from the battery 26 to the electronic device 30, the power may be supplied to the power supply circuit 28 without passing through the secondary battery 32.
<Third Embodiment> FIG. 6 is an explanatory diagram showing the configuration of a mounting device 34 and an electronic device 30 according to a third embodiment.
The configuration of the electronic device 30 is the same as that of the second embodiment, and a description thereof will be omitted.
The battery 26 included in the mounting device 10 described in the first embodiment and the second embodiment is a primary battery that performs only discharging, but the mounting member 24 of the mounting device 34 of the third embodiment is capable of charging and discharging. A secondary battery 36 (second secondary battery).
Also in the third embodiment, the secondary battery 36 on the mounting device 34 side can function as an auxiliary battery for the electronic device 30 as in the second embodiment.
That is, when the output of the secondary battery 32 on the electronic device 30 side is equal to or greater than a predetermined value, even when the electrodes 36a and 36b and the conductors 22a and 22b are electrically connected, the electronic device 30 ( No power is supplied to the secondary battery 32).
On the other hand, when the output of the secondary battery 32 becomes less than the predetermined value, the electronic device 30 receives power supply from the secondary battery 36 on the mounting device 34 side via the secondary battery 32, and It is provided to the circuit 28 to continue the operation of detecting the cardiac potential and the like, the operation of storing the detected cardiac potential, and the like.
That is, long-time operation of the electronic device 30 is realized by using the secondary battery 36 as an auxiliary battery.
In another embodiment, the secondary battery 32 may be used as an auxiliary battery, and the secondary battery 36 may be used as a battery for normal driving of the electronic device 30.
As a result, the same effects as in the second embodiment can be obtained in the configuration of the third embodiment.
Further, since the secondary battery 36 of the mounting device 34 is rechargeable, the secondary battery 36 can be charged from the secondary battery 32 on the electronic device 30 side, for example.
Similarly, when the electronic device 30 is connected to a cradle or the like and is electrically connected to an external power supply, the secondary battery 36 can be charged.
In other words, the secondary battery 36 can be charged when the electronic device 30 is not driven.
By the way, when the battery 40 (primary battery or secondary battery) is detachably attached to the attachment member 24 as in the attachment device 38 shown in FIG. 7, the battery 40 can be reused.
For example, when the electronic device 30 is fixed to the body surface of the user for a long time by the adhesive force of the attachment member 24, the adhesive force of the attachment member 24 may decrease due to sweating or adhesion of foreign matter.
In such a case, the attachment member 24 and the battery 40 can be separated, and only the attachment member 24 can be replaced with a new one (having sufficient adhesive strength).
Then, by fixing the charged battery 40, it is possible to reproduce the battery in a new mounting device 38.
That is, by replacing only the mounting member 24, the user can use the mounting device 38 which has sufficient adhesive strength, is clean, and can supply sufficient power at low cost.
When the battery 40 is fixed to the attachment member 24, the battery 40 may be fixed by the adhesive force of the attachment member 24, or may have a separate fixing structure.
For example, it may be fixed using a double-sided tape or a hook-and-loop fastener.
When the battery 40 is embedded and supported in the inner layer portion of the mounting member 24, the mounting member 24 has a multilayer structure, for example, a part of the surface layer can be opened and closed, and the battery 40 is stored in the inner layer, and the surface layer is , The battery 40 may be fixed.
Further, when the battery 40 is a primary battery, by providing the detachable structure as described above, the mounting member 24 and the battery 40 can be separated and separately separated and disposed, which facilitates recycling. .
<Fourth Embodiment> FIG. 8 is an explanatory diagram showing a configuration of a mounting device 42 according to a fourth embodiment.
By forming the whole or a part of the attachment member 24 with, for example, a gel layer containing sodium chloride and water as main components, an electrolyte is applied to the gel layer while maintaining the adhesion and flexibility as the attachment device. As a property.
That is, the battery 44 can be configured using the configuration of the mounting device 42.
In the case of FIG. 8, the mounting member 24 is entirely composed of a gel layer containing, for example, sodium chloride and water as main components, and a cathode electrode 46 and an anode electrode 48 are provided in an inner layer portion (in the gel layer) of the mounting member 24. And a separator 50.
The separator 50 is formed of a nonwoven fabric, a porous thin film, or the like disposed between the cathode electrode 46 and the anode electrode 48, and separates the cathode electrode 46 from the anode electrode 48 so as not to be in direct contact.
Further, the components of the battery 44 including the cathode electrode 46, the anode electrode 48, and the separator 50 are surrounded by a partition wall 52 made of a nonwoven fabric or a porous thin film, and the inside and outside of the battery 44 are insulated by a gel layer of the mounting member 24. are doing.
As described above, the attachment member 24 is also in contact with the electrodes 16a and 16b for detecting the cardiac potential provided in the electronic device 12 (30), so that the current of the battery 44 does not affect the detection of the cardiac potential. .
An electrode 46a (connector, contact, terminal, metal, conductor) is derived from the cathode electrode 46, and an electrode 48a (connector, contact, terminal, metal, conductor) is derived from the anode electrode 48, and the electronic device 12 (30 ) Can be electrically connected to the conductors 22a and 22b.
The mounting member 24 includes a first region 54a outside the partition 52 (a side not including the cathode electrode 46 and the anode electrode 48), a second region 54b inside the partition 52 including the cathode electrode 46, and an anode. And a third region 54c inside the partition wall 52 including the electrode 48.
In the battery 44, if the second region 54b and the third region 54c are electrolytes, ions can move between the cathode electrode 46 and the anode electrode 48, and discharging or charging becomes possible.
Therefore, the first region 54a need not be an electrolyte.
In the case of the present embodiment, the first region 54a, the second region 54b, and the third region 54c are composed of a gel layer containing sodium chloride and water as main components.
That is, the battery 44 is configured by embedding the cathode electrode 46, the anode electrode 48, the separator 50, the partition wall 52, and the like in one type of sheet-like mounting member 24.
By thus configuring the entire mounting member 24 with the gel layer of the electrolyte, the configuration can be simplified, which can contribute to cost reduction.
The type of metal forming the cathode electrode 46 and the anode electrode 48 and the components of the gel layer forming the mounting member 24 are appropriately selected according to the type of the battery to be formed.
As an example, as the battery terminal, the cathode electrode 46 (+ electrode) can be made of “copper” and the anode electrode 48 (− electrode) can be made of “zinc”.
Thus, when the mounting member 24 is provided with a gel layer having an electrolyte, and the cathode electrode 46 and the anode electrode 48 are arranged in the gel layer to constitute the battery 44, for example, an independent battery is attached to the mounting member 24. Compared with the case of fixing, the presence of the battery 44 can be less likely to affect the decrease in the flexibility of the mounting member 24.
As a result, it is possible to provide a flexible mounting device 42 that is easily bent and easily adheres to the body surface or the surface of the electronic device 12 (30).
FIG. 9 is an explanatory diagram showing the configuration of the battery 64 supported by the mounting member 24 (see FIG. 2).
FIG. 9 shows a case where a plurality of battery cells 66 to 70 (in FIG. 9, for example, three battery cells) are connected in series in order to increase the output voltage of the battery 64.
An insulating material 72 (insulating sheet) is arranged between the battery cells 66 and the battery cells 68 and between the battery cells 68 and the battery cells 70 to insulate the battery cells from each other.
In addition, a separator 74 is disposed between the cathode electrode 66a and the anode electrode 66b of the battery cell 66 so that the cathode electrode 66a and the anode electrode 66b do not directly contact.
Similarly, the cathode electrode 68a and the anode electrode 68b of the battery cell 68 and the cathode electrode 70a and the anode electrode 70b of the battery cell 70 are separated by the separator 74, respectively.
Each of the battery cells 66 to 70 is surrounded by an insulating member 76 so that the electrolyte 78 filled therein does not leak.
Then, the anode electrode 66b of the battery cell 66 and the cathode electrode 68a of the battery cell 68 are electrically connected, and the anode electrode 68b of the battery cell 68 and the cathode electrode 70a of the battery cell 70 are electrically connected.
That is, the battery cells 66 to 70 are connected in series, and the terminal 64a extending from the cathode electrode 66a and the terminal 64b extending from the anode electrode 70b become terminals of the battery 64, respectively, and are connected to the conductors 22a and 22b of the electronic device 12 (30). It can be connected electrically.
It is to be noted that the battery 64 can fold the battery cells 66 to 70, for example, by bending the battery 64 along the longitudinal direction of the insulating material 72.
That is, the battery cells can be stacked in a state of being connected in series, folded compactly, and supported by the mounting member 24 (see FIG. 2).
As a result, the output voltage can be increased without increasing the size (sheet area) of the mounting device 10 (34, 38, 42).
FIG. 10 is an explanatory diagram showing the configuration of the battery 80 supported by the mounting member 24 (see FIG. 2).
FIG. 10 shows a case in which a plurality of battery cells 82 to 86 (in FIG. 10, three battery cells as an example) are connected in parallel in order to increase the capacity of the battery 80.
An insulating material 88 (insulating sheet) is arranged between the battery cell 82 and the battery cell 84 and between the battery cell 84 and the battery cell 86 to insulate the battery cells from each other.
Further, a separator 90 is disposed between the cathode electrode 82a and the anode electrode 82b of the battery cell 82 so that the cathode electrode 82a and the anode electrode 82b do not come into direct contact with each other.
Similarly, the cathode electrode 84a and the anode electrode 84b of the battery cell 84 and the cathode electrode 86a and the anode electrode 86b of the battery cell 86 are separated by the separator 90, respectively.
Each of the battery cells 82 to 86 is surrounded by an insulating member 92 to prevent the electrolyte 94 filled therein from leaking out.
Then, while the cathode electrodes 82a, 84a, 86a are electrically connected in series, the anode electrodes 82b, 84b, 86b are electrically connected in series, and as a whole battery 80, the battery cell 82 and the battery cell 84 Battery cells 86 are electrically connected in parallel.
b serves as a terminal of the battery 80, and can be electrically connected to the conductors 22a and 22b of the electronic device 12 (30).
In the battery 80, for example, the battery cells 82 to 86 can be folded by bending the insulating material 88 along the longitudinal direction.
That is, the battery cells can be stacked in a state of being connected in parallel, folded compactly, and supported by the mounting member 24 (see FIG. 2).
As a result, the battery capacity can be increased without increasing the size (sheet area) of the mounting device 10 (34, 38, 42).
In FIGS. 9 and 10, the number of battery cells connected in series or in parallel is appropriately selected according to the output voltage required for the mounting device 10 (34, 38, 42) and the required battery capacity. Can be.
However, when the battery cell is a cell for a secondary battery, it is desirable to determine the number of battery cells to be connected in consideration of a charge / discharge cycle and a charge / discharge amount.
<Fifth Embodiment> FIG. 11 is an explanatory diagram showing a configuration of a mounting device 96 according to a fifth embodiment.
In the attachment device 96, the battery 98 is fixed to the attachment member 24, similarly to the configuration of the other embodiments.
However, the battery 98 differs from the battery 26 of the mounting device 10 shown in FIG. 2 in that electrodes 96a and 96b for discharging or charging are arranged at positions separated from the battery 98 by lead wires 98a and 98b.
In the case of the mounting device 96 shown in FIG. 11, the connecting member 100a having a band shape and flexibility in a direction in which the longitudinal side 24c (24e) extends from substantially the center of the short side 24f of the mounting member 24. The connection piece, the winding piece, and the fixing piece) are formed in a protruding state.
The electrodes 96a, 96b are arranged on the connecting member 100a, for example, at a predetermined interval in parallel with the side portion 24f.
Similarly, in the direction in which the longitudinal side portion 24c (24e) extends from substantially the center of the side portion 24d of the mounting member 24, a strip-shaped connecting member 100b similar to the connecting member 100a (connecting piece, winding piece, fixing piece). Are formed in a protruding state.
In the example of FIG. 11, the electrodes 96a and 96b are not arranged on the connecting member 100b. However, for example, the electrode 96a may be arranged on the connecting member 100a and the electrode 96b may be arranged on the connecting member 100b.
Further, the connection members 100a and 100b include a fixing member 102 such as a hook-and-loop fastener at a position near an end far from the side 24f (24d).
FIG. 12 shows a configuration of an electronic device 104 to which the mounting device 96 thus configured is mounted.
The basic configuration of the electronic device 104 is the same as that of the electronic device 12 (30) shown in the other embodiments, except that the conductors 108a, The position of 108b is different.
In the case of the electronic device 12 shown in FIG. 1, the conductors 22a and 22b are arranged substantially at the center of the surface 14a of the housing 14 with which the first surface 24a of the mounting member 24 of the mounting device 10 contacts.
On the other hand, in the case of the electronic device 104, the conductors 108a and 108b are arranged on the back surface 106b opposite to the front surface 106a of the housing 106 with which the first surface 24a of the mounting member 24 of the mounting device 96 contacts.
Further, the conductors 108a and 108b are arranged at positions near the side 106c of the back surface 106b.
That is, as shown in FIG. 12, the connection member 100a is attached to the first surface 24a of the attachment device 96 (the attachment member 24) while the surface 106a (sensor surface, top surface, first wall) of the electronic device 104 is in close contact with the first surface 24a. , 100b are wound so as to contact the rear surface 106b side of the housing 106.
That is, the conductors 108a and 108b are arranged at positions where they can be in electrical contact with the electrodes 96a and 96b arranged on the connection member 100a.
In addition, a fixing member 110 (for example, a hook-and-loop fastener) is disposed on the back surface 106b of the housing 106 at a position where the fixing member 102 can be mechanically connected to the fixing member 102 provided on the connection members 100a and 100b.
When mounting the mounting device 96 configured as described above to the electronic device 104, first, the first surface 24a of the mounting device 96 (the mounting member 24) is brought into close contact with the surface 106a of the housing 106 of the electronic device 104.
In this case, it is necessary to position the mounting position in order to electrically connect the electrodes 26a, 26b (see FIG. 2) and the conductors 22a, 22b as in the mounting device 10 and the electronic device 12 shown in FIG. Absent.
Thereafter, the connection member 100a is wound around the back surface 106b so as to be wound around the housing 106, and the electrode 96a and the conductor 108a and the electrode 96b and the conductor 108b are electrically connected.
In this case, since the connection member 100a is a flexible band-shaped member, the position can be easily corrected by the flexibility of the connection member 100a even if the mounting posture of the mounting device 96 with respect to the electronic device 104 is slightly shifted.
As a result, electrical connection between electrode 96a and conductor 108a and between electrode 96b and conductor 108b can be facilitated.
Also, at the time of this winding operation, the connection between the fixing member 102 on the mounting device 96 side and the fixing member 110 on the electronic device 104 side (for example, connection of a hook-and-loop fastener) is performed, and the mounting device 96 is fixed to the electronic device 104.
Similarly, the connection member 100b is wound around the rear surface 106b so as to be wound around the housing 106, and the connection between the fixing member 102 on the mounting device 96 side and the fixing member 110 on the electronic device 104 side (for example, connection of a hook-and-loop fastener) is performed. Then, the mounting device 96 is fixed to the electronic device 104.
As described above, since the mounting device 96 is mounted on the electronic device 104 by the adhesive force of the mounting member 24 and the fixing force generated by winding the connecting members 100a and 100b around the housing 106, the mounting state of the both is stable. (The close contact state between the mounting device 96 and the electronic device 104) can be maintained for a long time.
As a result, a stable biological signal can be detected by the electronic device 104.
Further, as shown in FIG. 12, the conductors 108a and 108b are arranged on the side different from the body surface in the housing 106, so that the sense of security of the user can be improved.
Note that, in the example of FIG. 12, the case where the conductors 108a and 108b are arranged on the back surface 106b of the housing 106 is shown. However, similar effects can be obtained by arranging on any surface other than the surface 106a. be able to.
Further, in the examples shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, the connection members 100a and 100b are wound around the ends of the back surface 106b of the housing 106, but, for example, the connection members 100a and 100b are wound around a wide area of the back surface 106b. You may do so.
For example, the connection member 100a and the connection member 100b may be overlapped on the back surface 106b so as to completely surround the housing 106.
In this case, the mountability (adhesion) of the mounting device 96 to the electronic device 104 can be further improved.
Further, in the case where the electronic device 104 is wound and fixed by using the connection members 100a and 100b in this manner, the displacement and dropping of the electronic device 104 with respect to the mounting device 96 can be further suppressed.

When the biological information indicates a pulse wave signal or a temperature signal, the biological information is converted into a pulse or body temperature, and health condition information is created based on the pulse or body temperature.
When the server 206 creates the health condition information, for example, it creates an electrocardiogram based on the transition of the biological information for a predetermined period, or creates a transition graph of pulse and body temperature.
Further, diagnostic information based on the transition may be created.
In addition, when the user continuously transmits the biological information to the server 206 using the personal ID, the server 206 performs the comparison based on the comparison between the past analysis result and the diagnosis information and the latest analysis result and the diagnosis information. In addition to performing a long-term transition and diagnosis of health status, for example, future advice and the like may be created as health status information.
The server 206 stores the created health examination information in the storage device 206a, and returns the health examination information to the user who transmitted the biological information via the network 204.
For example, when the user has transmitted the biological information via the communication terminal 200, the medical examination information is displayed on the display screen of the communication terminal 200.
In addition, when the user directly transmits the biological information to the server 206 using the communication function of the electronic device 12, the server 206 transmits the health examination information to the electronic device 12.
When receiving the health check information, the electronic device 12 transfers the received health check information to the own communication terminal 200 or personal computer 210, and the health check information is displayed on the display screen of the communication terminal 200 or the personal computer 210. Will be displayed.
Similarly, when the electronic device 12 transmits the biological information to the server 206 via the wireless router 208, the electronic device 12 transmits the health check information to the user's personal computer 210, and displays the health check information on the display screen of the personal computer 210. Information may be displayed.
The medical examination information transmitted from the server 206 may be stored in the communication terminal 200 or the personal computer 210.
